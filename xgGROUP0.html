              <h6><b>The Group </b><br>
                With the recruitments of Xavier Gandibleux in 2004 as full
                professor in Computer Science by the University of Nantes,
                followed by Anthony Przybylski in 2007 as senior lecturers in
                Computer Science, the core of the group consists of two
                permanent members. From 2006 to 2008, Matthias Ehrgott has been
                permanent member of the group as director of research at the
                CNRS.<br>
                <br>
                Non-permanent members are involved in the group for some
                periods. Sana Belmokhtar (from Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne)
                has joined us as researcher in 2006-2007. She is now assistant
                professor at&nbsp; ESIEE PARIS. Hadrien Hugot (from LAMSADE,
                University of Paris-Dauphine) got in 2007-2008 a post-doctoral
                position funded by the CNRS. Benoit Guédas and Guillaume Pinot
                (both from IRCCyN, Ecole Centrale de Nantes) have been
                associated to the group while they served as lecturer in the
                department. Zohra Aoudia (from Université de Bejaia) has joined
                us for a period of 18 months.<br>
                <br>
                Master and PhD students contribute to the works of the team.
                Recently Quentin Delmée has defended its PhD thesis and another
                PhD student will joint us soon. Former PhD students who prepared
                their thesis under our supervision are Xavier Delorme (now
                professor, Ecole des Mines de Saint Etienne), Anthony Przybylski
                (now assistant professor, University of Nantes), Fabien
                Degoutin, Julien Jorge, Benoit Guédas, Hugo Fouchal, Aurélien
                Mérel, Thomas Vincent, and Audrey Cerqueus (now assistant
                professor, Ecole des Mines de Saint Etienne). </h6>
              <h6><b>Research Activities </b><br>
                Our work, mainly based on discrete optimisation in Operations
                Research, focuses on the accumulation of knowledge towards the
                development of advanced optimization methods that are capable of
                solving complex optimization problems in reasonable time. The
                optimization problems of interest are reference problems in
                discrete optimization and their application in socio-economic
                contexts, such as railway transportation (capacity of railway
                infrastructure), and communication networks (routing policies,
                deployment of new infrastructure).<br>
                <br>
                In this context, the motivation characterizing the research
                direction of the group is to study, model, and solve large scale
                multiobjective (mixed) integer optimization problems. Procedures
                for these problems are essentially problem dependent and employ,
                among others, efficient enumerative methods (two phase method;
                branch and bound/cut) or hybrid optimization techniques
                (multiobjective metaheuristics and exact algorithms). Our
                research directions are: </h6>
              <ol>
                <h6>
                  <li><i>Fundamental</i>: <br>
                    Study, characterization, and understanding of (mixed)
                    integer and combinatorial multiobjective optimization
                    problems. </li>
                  <li><i>Methodological and algorthmical</i>: <br>
                    New techniques and methods for the solution of large scale

                    optimization problems; Development of algorithms to improve
                    the efficient solution of NP-hard single and multiobjective
                    problems. </li>
                  <li><i>Validation and verification</i>: <br>
                    Application to real world multiobjective optimization
                    problems with the ultimate goal of being able to solve
                    concrete problems in complex real world environments
                    (production systems, transport, communication, environmental
                    policy). Most applications are collaborations with
                    industrial partners. </li>

                  <li><i>State of the Art Annotated Bibliographic Survey.</i> <br>
                    For many years we collected and summarized the literature on
                    multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems.
                    In 2000 and in 2002, papers reporting our synthesis have
                    been published. Later we did a similar work about
                    multi-objective metaheuristics (MOMH). <br>

                    Approximation methods for MCDM problems have received a lot
                    of attention in recent years. With two Japanese colleagues
                    we introduced the path-relinking concept for MOMH with
                    success for many MOCO problems.<br>

                    Introduced in the nineties by Ulungu and Teghem, this method
                    has been considered as a generic method for bi-objective
                    optimization problems. One of the major contributions
                    Anthony Przybylski's PhD thesis has been the generalisation
                    of this method for dealing with problems with more than two
                    objectives. <br>

                    With the cooperation of partners we developed methodologies,

                Invited professors who visited us these last years for a period
                of one month were e.g. Kathrin Klamroth in 2005 (University of
                Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany), Eric Taillard in 2006 (HEIG-VD,

                We have a long tradition of working with colleagues in OR and
                MCDM. Several collaborations are on-going with Matthias Ehrgott
                (Lancaster University, UK), Stefan Ruzika (University of
                Koblenz, Germany), Kathrin Klamroth (Bergische Universität
                Wuppertal, Germany), Sophie Parragh (Johannes Kepler Universität
                Linz, Austria), Karl Doerner (University of Vienna, Austria),
                Dario Da Silva (University of Nottingham, UK), Naoki Katoh
                (Kyoto University, Japan) and Hiroyuki Morita (Osaka Prefecture
                University, Japan) to name a few.<br>
                <br>
                Since 1999 we are involved in research works related to railway
                transportation. Joaquin Rodriguez (from IFSTTAR, the French
                National Research Institute on Transportation and Security) is
                one of our collaborators on this topic.<br>
                <br>
                To conclude this section, we are collaborating also with
                colleagues of regional institutions, e.g. Saïd Hanafi
                (Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France), Frédéric Saubion
                (University of Angers), and Marc Sevaux (University of South
                Brittany-Lorient).</h6>
              <h6><b>Projects </b><br>
                The group is regularly involved in regional (e.g. LigeRO),
                national (e.g. ANR GUEPARD) and international (e.g. ANR-DFG
                vOpt) research projects. </h6>
              <h6><b>Software </b><br>
                <i>RECIFE</i> is a decision support system specifically designed
                for the analysis of railway infrastructure capacity. For a given
                station or node of the network, various functionalities such as
                verifying the feasibility of expected traffic, studying
                infrastructure saturation and stability of resulting timetables
                are offered to a decision maker. Two geographical situations
                have already been studied: The Pierrefitte-Gonesse node located
                north of Paris and the Lille-Flandres station.<br>
                <br>
                <i>vOptSolver</i> is an <a href="https://github.com/vOptSolver/vOptSolver">open-source</a>
                ecosystem developed in Julia, for modeling and solving
                multi-objective linear optimization problems (MOCO, MOIP, MOMIP,
                MOLP).
                It integrates several exact algorithms for computing a complete
                set of non-dominated points for structured and non-structured
                optimization problems with at least two objectives. vOptSolver
                is composed of two packages integrated to the collection of
                Julia packages: vOptGeneric and vOptSpecific.</h6>
