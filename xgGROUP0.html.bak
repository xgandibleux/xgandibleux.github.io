From 2006 to 2008, Matthias Ehrgott has been                permanent member of the group as director of research at the                CNRS.<br>                <br>                Non-permanent members are involved in the group for some                periods. Sana Belmokhtar (from Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne)                has joined us as researcher in 2006-2007. She is now assistant                professor at&nbsp; ESIEE PARIS.

Zohra Aoudia (from Université de Bejaia) has joined                us for a period of 18 months.<br>                <br>                Master and PhD students contribute to the works of the team.                Currently Quentin Delmée is preparing its PhD thesis and another                PhD student will joint us soon. Former PhD students who prepared                their thesis under our supervision are Xavier Delorme (now                professor, Ecole des Mines de Saint Etienne), Anthony Przybylski                (now assistant professor, University of Nantes), Fabien                Degoutin, Julien Jorge, Benoit Guédas, Hugo Fouchal, Aurélien                Mérel, Thomas Vincent, and Audrey Cerqueus (now assistant                professor, Ecole des Mines de Saint Etienne). </h6>              <h6><b>Research Activities </b><br>                Our work, mainly based on discrete optimisation in Operations                Research, focuses on the accumulation of knowledge towards the                development of advanced optimization methods that are capable of                solving complex optimization problems in reasonable time. The                optimization problems of interest are reference problems in                discrete optimization and their application in socio-economic                contexts, such as railway transportation (capacity of railway                infrastructure), and communication networks (routing policies,                deployment of new infrastructure).<br>                <br>                In this context, the motivation characterizing the research                direction of the group is to study, model, and solve large scale                multiobjective (mixed) integer optimization problems. Procedures                for these problems are essentially problem dependent and employ,                among others, efficient enumerative methods (two phase method;                branch and bound/cut) or hybrid optimization techniques                (multiobjective metaheuristics and exact algorithms).
