He is a leading                researcher in multi-objective optimization and metaheuristics.                With A. Fréville, A. Jaszkiewicz and R. Slowinski, he was the                guest editor of the first special issue of one International                journal (Journal of Heuristics) devoted to "Multi-Objective                MetaHeuristics" (published in 2000).<br>                <br>                Xavier Gandibleux -together with the members of his research                group and a number of international collaborators from Belgium,                Poland, Spain, Germany, USA, Japan, New-Zealand- has worked to                develop high performance algorithms for several multiple                objective NP-hard problems, such as the assigment problem, the                0-1 knapsack problem, the set packing problem as well as other                optimization problems. Together, they have pioneered new                techniques for solving multi-objective large-scale optimization                problems, including MOTS, a multi-objective tabu search                (1996,1997), hybrid methods combining exact and approximative                techniques (1997, 2000), valid inequalities for the 0-1                bi-objective knapsack problem (1997, 2000), the path-relinking                in multi-objective optimization (2003, 2004), bound sets (2000,                2007), and exact algorithms for multi-objective versions of e.g.                shortest path problems with a MaxMin cost function (2006),<span                  style="font-family: serif;">                </span>linear assignment problems (2006, 2010), knapsack                problems (2008, 2015), mixed integer linear programming problems                (2013), facility location problems (2017),<span style="font-family: serif;">                </span>and open-source solvers (2017).<br>                <br>                With Matthias Ehrgott (Lancaster University, UK), Xavier                Gandibleux made a broad synthesis of the Multi-Objective                Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) and Multi-Objective                MetaHeuristics (MOMH) fields.
