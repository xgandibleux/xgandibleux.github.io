                Xavier Gandibleux is a full professor in computer science at the
                <a href="http://www.univ-nantes.fr/">University of Nantes</a>
                (France) since September 2004. Before joining the University of
                Nantes, he was a lecturer from 1993 to 1995 and a senior
                lecturer (maître de conférences) from 1995 to 2004, in computer
                science at the <a href="http://www.univ-valenciennes.fr/">University

                <br>
                Active in discrete multi-criteria decision-making since the
                beginning of the nineties, Xavier Gandibleux's main areas of
                research are multi-objective and combinatorial optimization,
                with applications in complex environments (production systems,
                railway transportation, computer networks). He is a leading
                researcher in multi-objective optimization and metaheuristics.
                With A. Fréville, A. Jaszkiewicz and R. Slowinski, he was the
                guest editor of the first special issue of one International
                journal (<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/102935/?Content+Status=Accepted&amp;sort=p_OnlineDate&amp;sortorder=desc&amp;v=condensed">Journal
                  of Heuristics</a>) devoted to "<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h1t0503x22t30r87/">Multi-Objective
                  MetaHeuristics</a>" (published in 2000).<br>
                <br>
                Xavier Gandibleux together with the members of his research
                group and a number of international collaborators from Belgium,
                Poland, Spain, Germany, USA, Japan, New-Zealand has worked to
                develop high performance algorithms for several multiple
                objective NP-hard problems, such as the assigment problem, the
                0-1 knapsack problem, the set packing problem as well as other
                optimization problems. Together, they have pioneered new
                techniques for solving multi-objective large-scale optimization
                problems, including MOTS, a multi-objective tabu search
                (1996,1997), hybrid methods combining exact and approximative
                techniques (1997,2000), valid inequalities for the 0-1
                bi-objective knapsack problem (1997,2000), and the
                path-relinking in multi-objective optimization (2003,2004).<br>
                <br>

                  Ehrgott (Lancaster University, UK)</a>, Xavier Gandibleux made
                a broad synthesis of the Multi-Objective Combinatorial
                Optimization (<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/kjep5jk0vdq47uwc/?p=0140b754fb824e06b15768579868d0a7&amp;pi=0">MOCO</a>)
                and Multi-Objective MetaHeuristics (<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/lq1p1565737144k0/?p=29c19a0753784020b9ac6fce2049d77c&amp;pi=0">MOMH</a>)
                fields. Started in 1997, this work has resulted in the
                publication of a book and many surveys. They have been invited
                to speak at the plenary sessions of many well-established
                international conferences (MCDM 2000, Ankara, Turkey; MOPGP
                2002, Nara, Japan; EMO 2005, Guanajuato, Mexico; MIC 2005,
                Vienna, Austria) in order to present a tutorial on these topics.<br>
                <br>
                Professor Gandibleux has supervised and worked on several real
                world applications, including multi-objective routing in IP
                networks, railway infrastructure capacity, and decision-aid for
                the supervision of large industrial systems. He has initiated
                three R&amp;D projects with such partners as Alcatel and the
                SNCF. He has been the editor of <a href="xgPAPERS.html">4 books</a>,
                and has co-authored more than <a href="xgPAPERS.html">40 papers</a>
                for peer-reviewed journals and proceedings in the field of
                operations research: Multi-objective Optimization, Combinatorial
                Optimization, Metaheuristics, Evolutionary Algorithms and
                Decision-Aid Systems. He is the supervisor of Ph.D candidates
                and Master thesis. </h6>
